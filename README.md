# Department-Mangement
In Engineering college there are various department.Here I have taken few departments and how many students and teachers are there in a departments and their details.
ORM - Object Relational Mapping.
Hibernate is ORM framework used here.It maps an object-oriented domain model to a traditional relational database.
So to map them I used to ManytoOne Mapping.
**@ManyToOne** - mapping  many instances of the entity are mapped to one instance of another entity (eg many items in one cart)

The application is build using **MVC Architecture**
